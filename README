SVN-Look is a caching wrapper aroung the svnlook command.

The svnlook command is the workhorse of Subversion hook scripts, being
used to gather all sorts of information about a repository, its
revisions, and its transactions. This script provides a simple object
oriented interface to a specific svnlook invocation, to make it easier
to hook writers to get and use the information they need. Moreover,
all the information gathered buy calling the svnlook command is cached
in the object, avoiding repetitious calls.
