# ABSTRACT: A caching wrapper around the svnlook command.

use File::Spec::Functions;
use List::MoreUtils qw{uniq};

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use SVN::Look;
  my $revlook = SVN::Look->new('/repo/path', -r => 123);
  my $author  = $revlook->author();
  my $msg     = $revlook->log_msg();
  my @added_files   = $revlook->added();
  my @updated_files = $revlook->updated();
  my @deleted_files = $revlook->deleted();
  my @changed_files = $revlook->changed();
  my $file_contents = $revlook->cat('/path/to/file/in/repository');

  my $trxlook = SVN::Look->new('/repo/path', -t => 123);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The svnlook command is the workhorse of Subversion hook scripts, being
used to gather all sorts of information about a repository, its
revisions, and its transactions. This module provides a simple object
oriented interface to a specific svnlook invocation, to make it easier
to hook writers to get and use the information they need. Moreover,
all the information gathered by calling the svnlook command is cached
in the object, avoiding repetitious calls.

=method B<new> REPO [, WHAT, NUMBER]

The SVN::Look constructor needs one or three arguments:

=over

=item REPO is the path to the repository.

=item WHAT must be either '-r' or '-t', specifying if the third
argument is a revision number or a transaction number, respectively.
If neither -r or -t is specified, the HEAD revision is used.

=item NUMBER is either a revision or transaction NUMBER, as specified
by WHAT.
