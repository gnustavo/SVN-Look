=head1 NAME

SVN::Look - A caching wrapper aroung the svnlook command.

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.27

=cut

our $VERSION = '0.27';

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use SVN::Look;
  my $revlook = SVN::Look->new('/repo/path', -r => 123);
  my $author  = $revlook->author();
  my $msg     = $revlook->log_msg();
  my @added_files   = $revlook->added();
  my @updated_files = $revlook->updated();
  my @deleted_files = $revlook->deleted();
  my @changed_files = $revlook->changed();
  my $file_contents = $revlook->cat('/path/to/file/in/repository');

  my $trxlook = SVN::Look->new('/repo/path', -t => 123);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The svnlook command is the workhorse of Subversion hook scripts, being
used to gather all sorts of information about a repository, its
revisions, and its transactions. This script provides a simple object
oriented interface to a specific svnlook invocation, to make it easier
to hook writers to get and use the information they need. Moreover,
all the information gathered buy calling the svnlook command is cached
in the object, avoiding repetitious calls.

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item B<new> REPO [, WHAT, NUMBER]

The SVN::Look constructor needs one or three arguments:

=over

=item REPO is the path to the repository.

=item WHAT must be either '-r' or '-t', specifying if the third
argument is a revision number or a transaction number, respectively.
If neither -r or -t is specified, the HEAD revision is used.

=item NUMBER is either a revision or transaction NUMBER, as specified
by WHAT.
